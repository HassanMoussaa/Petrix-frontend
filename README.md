### Postman Collections
Collection to import: [PETRIX Postman collection](https://github.com/HassanMoussaa/Petrix-frontend/blob/main/PETRIX%20_Server.postman_collection.json)
ðŸ”– How to use this collection

Step 1: Send requests
RESTful APIs allow you to perform CRUD operations using the POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods.
This collection contains each of these request types. Open each request and click "Send" to see what happens.

Step 2: View responses
Observe the response tab for status code (200 OK), response time, and size.

Step 3: Send new Body data
Update or add new data in "Body" in the POST request. Typically, Body data is also used in PUT request.

{
    "name": "Add your name in the body"
}

Step 4: Update the variable
Variables enable you to store and reuse values in Postman. We have created a variable called base_url with the sample request https://postman-api-learner.glitch.me. Replace it with your API endpoint to customize this collection.
